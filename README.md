# CG model of heparin
CG modelling of heparin for MD simulations using LAMMPS.

The simulations correspond to a simple model consisting of charged beads connected by springs (including angles and dihedrals) in implicit solvent with electrostatics, modelled at the Debye approximation level.

The performance of the model is checked against experimental results for the radius of gyration available [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283609013230?via%3Dihub).
